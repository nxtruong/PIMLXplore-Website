    - A public data set of measurements from real HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) systems of real buildings in the US. The data points include room temperatures, setpoints, mass flow rates, operation modes, among others.  The data can be used for training machine learning models to predict outputs of the HVAC systems, such as room temperatures.  PIML methods can include physical properties such as monotonicity and energy conservation.
