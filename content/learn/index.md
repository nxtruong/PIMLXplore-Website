**Physics-informed machine learning (PIML)** is a set of methods and tools that systematically integrate machine learning algorithms with physical constraints and abstract mathematical models developed in scientific and engineering domains. As opposed to purely data-driven methods, PIML models can be trained with additional information obtained by enforcing physical laws such as energy and mass conservation, stability, or invariance.  The integration of machine learning and physics can yield *more effective, physically consistent, and data-efficient models*.


Here you will find resources for learning about physics-informed machine learning (PIML) in science and engineering.
